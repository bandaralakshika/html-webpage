      <h3>Hoppers</h3>
      <p>Hoppers, known as "Appa" in Sri Lanka, are a beloved culinary delight enjoyed across the island, both as a breakfast staple and as a snack.<br/>
         These bowl-shaped pancakes are made from a batter of fermented rice flour or wheat flour, coconut milk, and coconut water, giving them a distinct flavor and texture.<br/>

         This dish features chopped-up pieces of godamba roti (a type of flatbread) stir-fried with an assortment of ingredients, resulting in a tantalizing medley of flavors and textures.<br/>
         The preparation of Kottu Roti is a spectacle in itself, with skilled chefs chopping the roti on a hot griddle using metal blades, creating a rhythmic clattering sound that echoes through the streets.<br/>

      <h3>Fish Ambul Thiyal</h3>
      <p>Fish Ambul Thiyal, a signature dish from the southern coastal regions of Sri Lanka, is a culinary masterpiece renowned for its bold and tangy flavors.<br/>
         This dish, also known as "Sour Fish Curry," showcases the island's rich tradition of using locally available ingredients to create dishes bursting with taste.<br/>
         At the heart of Fish Ambul Thiyal is the process of "tempering" or "frying" the fish in a mixture of spices, including black pepper, fenugreek seeds, cinnamon, and curry leaves.<br/>
         This step imparts a deep, aromatic flavor to the fish, enhancing its natural taste.
         What sets Fish Ambul Thiyal apart is the liberal use of goraka, a dried fruit native to Sri Lanka, which lends the dish its characteristic tanginess.<br/>
         The goraka is soaked and then added to the curry, infusing it with a unique sourness that balances the richness of the spices.
         Whether enjoyed at home with family or savored at a local restaurant overlooking the azure waters of the Indian Ocean, Fish Ambul Thiyal offers a culinary journey that celebrates the bounty of the sea and the vibrant traditions of Sri Lankan cuisine.</p>
